# Purplship Shipping API

The purplship shipping API is powered by REST. Rather than dealing 
with non-standardized, often poorly documented carrier webservices 
and arcane technologies such as SOAP. purplship proposes a unified 
and intuitive REST API compatible with all supported carriers services.


## API References

purplship exposes a set of REST API resources. The full references
are accessible at `/openapi/` for the full description of the service
APIs from your browser.

## Playground

You can download the purplship `OpenAPI` specification to quickly
familiarize yourself with the REST API and perform example requests
by importing it in tools such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/)
