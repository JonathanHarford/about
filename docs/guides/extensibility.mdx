The obvious way to extend the purplship server would be to download
the source code and modify it directly. After all it's an open-source
platform. We advise against this as experience teaches us that once
your codebase diverges from the upstream purplship, it becomes
hard to keep it updated.

Because of this we advice the development of **Apps** that are
external applications that talk to purplship server using its **GraphQL**
and **REST APIs** additionally, they can subscribe to events using
**webhooks**.

## Shipping API

Purplship brings a set of APIs to interact with shipping provider services.
You can use the purplship REST OpenAPI to get live rates, generate labels,
track shipments, manage pickups and more.

## Shipping Data

Purplship offer the possibility to store the shipping data related to your
shipping operations in a **database**. The purplship GraphQL API allows you
to access, query and visualize that data.

## Custom Carrier Integration

In addition to being open source, purplship exposes its low level shipping
SDK that abstracts the shipping provider integration constructs. This allows
you to add your custom shipping carrier integration to the purplship umbrella.
