The obvious way to extend the purplship server would be to download
the source code and modify it directly. After all it's an open-source
platform. We advise against this as experience teaches us that once
your store diverges from the upstream purplship server, it becomes
hard to keep it updated.

Because of this we advice the use development of **Apps** that are
external applications that talk to purplship server using its
**GraphQL** and **REST APIs** additionally, they can subscribe to events
using **webhooks**.
