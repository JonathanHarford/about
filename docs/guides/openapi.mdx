# The Multi-carrier Shipping API

purplship shipping API is powered by REST. Rather than dealing with
non-standardized, often poorly documented carrier webservices and
arcane technologies such as SOAP. purplship proposes a unified and
intuitive REST API compatible for all supported carriers services.


## API References

purplship exposes a set of REST API resources. The full references
are accessible at `/openapi/` for the full description of the service
APIs from your browser.

familiarize yourself with the REST API and perform example requests
by importing it in tools such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/)
